How to start a server:
-Run Server_main.java file under server package. 
The server can take a port number from the command line with arguments (-p portNumber)   
For example: "Server_main -p 1234" runs the server on port 1234. 
If either a port is not specified or the arguments are invalid, the Server is run on the default port 4444.

How to start a Client:
The client can be run by running Client_main.java. Then, enter the IP address and port that the server is located on
in the appropriate fields in the dialog that opens.

Operating system:
-Work on Windows, Mac and Linux.
